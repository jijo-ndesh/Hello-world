# Hello-world
getting started
Hello there!
I'm new to this but I know that it's going to be real fun and I'm bringing lots of brilliant ideas onboard so watch this space.
I dream of being the next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates since I find that there is no african representation when it comes to operating system and I might as well have coding done in swahili or even in my mother tongue,Kikuyu or probably even have 'CHAI' replacing java as the coding language that will take programming in the 21st century to the next level.
enough said.
I am welcoming any comments or criticism.
but to be straight to the point,really looking to have a splendid experience on github,thanks for now.
